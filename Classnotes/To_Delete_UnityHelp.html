                    You are free to use anything IDE you like, 
                    the default IDE for Unity is 
                    Microsoft Visual Studio Community, which works very well also. 
                    </li>
            <li><b>WebGL Build Support</b>: Please make sure to install this module 
                    for our playtesting (for part-2 of this class will be based on WebGL builds. 
                    Additionally, if you are running on a Mac, 
                    please also install <b>Windows Build Support</b> 
                    such that you can build for PC EXE and the TA can run your assignment submissions. </li>
